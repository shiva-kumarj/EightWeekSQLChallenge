# Data Cleaning and Manipulation

I wrote a SQL script that performs data cleaning and manipulation on various columns in multiple tables such as `customer_orders`, `runner_orders`, `pizza_names`, and `pizza_toppings`. I first selected specific columns and then performed various operations such as:
- Setting null values to certain columns 
- Replacing null values with a default of '0' 
- Cleaning and formatting columns by calling custom functions, and 
- Inserting a new row and altering the data type of certain columns.

I also utilized various SQL functions such as `round`, `coalesce`, and `lower` to format and standardize the data in the columns.
